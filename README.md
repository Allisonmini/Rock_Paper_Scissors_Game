# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game ✊🖐️✌️
A simple "Rock-Paper-Scissors" Game in JAVAFX


This is a simple desktop Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using JavaFX. The project idea is inspired by one of the exercises from my CS class. I later enhanced it by creating a fully functional graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX, applying what I learned about FXML, CSS, and controller-based architecture.

This version allows the player to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors, generates a random choice for the computer, and displays the result. It also includes a reset feature to play again. It really helped me understand how to structure modern Java GUIs and apply event-driven programming.

💬 Personal Note

As a Computer Science student, I enjoy turning class exercises into real projects. This was originally a simple command-line assignment, but creating a GUI with JavaFX made it much more fun and meaningful. It’s one of my first JavaFX GUI projects, and I’m proud of how it turned out!
