# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game
A simple "Rock-Paper-Scissors" Game in JAVAFX


This is a simple desktop Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using JavaFX. The project idea is inspired by a terminal-based assignment in one of my computer science classes. I later enhanced it by creating a fully functional graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX, applying what I learned about FXML, CSS, and controller-based architecture.

Inspiration

Originally a simple command-line program assigned during my CS class, this game was reimagined as a GUI project to make it more engaging and playable. The goal was to take a basic programming exercise and use it as a foundation for learning and experimenting with JavaFX features.

💡 What I Learned
	•	Building JavaFX applications with FXML
	•	Styling UI components with JavaFX CSS
	•	Structuring applications using MVC (Model-View-Controller) concepts
	•	Handling user input and game logic in a GUI context

💻 Features
	•	Rock, Paper, and Scissors button-based gameplay
	•	Random computer choices
	•	Result display (Win, Lose, or Draw)
	•	Clean and styled interface using JavaFX

🛠️ Technologies Used
	•	Java
	•	JavaFX
	•	FXML
	•	CSS

🚀 How to Run
	1.	Ensure Java and JavaFX are properly set up on your system.
	2.	Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-paper-scissors-javafx.git


	3.	Open the project in a JavaFX-compatible IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA).
	4.	Run the Main.java file or the entry point of the application.

🙌 Acknowledgments

Thanks to my CS class for the original terminal-based assignment that inspired this project and helped me learn the foundations of Java programming and GUI development.
